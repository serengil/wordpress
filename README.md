Even though exporting contents enabled in wordpress, media files excluded in this exporting operation. Accessing these media files via ftp connection is expected. However, if you use wordpress.com's own hosting system, then ftp access is forbidden. Herein, switching hosting from wordpress to your own hosting is a big trouble. This basic project mainly process wordpress exported file, download and stores all media files on your computer. You just need to run ExportMedia.java file and specify wordpress export file location.
